# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new, empty portfolio website project. The directory structure and development environment are not yet set up.

## Initial Setup Recommendations

When starting development on this portfolio website:

1. **Framework Selection**: Determine the frontend framework/technology stack (React, Vue, vanilla HTML/CSS, etc.)
2. **Package Manager**: Initialize with npm, yarn, or pnpm
3. **Build Tools**: Set up build tooling (Vite, webpack, etc.)
4. **Development Server**: Configure local development server
5. **Deployment**: Consider deployment strategy (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)

## Common Commands

_Note: Commands will be added once the project structure is established_

## Architecture

_Note: Architecture details will be documented as the project develops_

## Development Notes

This is a portfolio website project in the early planning/setup phase
No existing codebase or configuration files are present
Future instances should help establish the project structure based on user requirements

## Tasks

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
